## Why I'm doing this?

Is there nothing more useful I can do?
Honestly I don't think so for several reasons. First is there is not much I can build by my own ü§ì

The idea of this project is:

- [having a technical playground for a following project](####Having-a-technical-playground)
- [getting familiar with tools like](####-Getting-familiar-with-popular-tools)
  - [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
  - [Guthub](https://github.com/)
- [having a checklist about technical stuff for my own](####technical-checklist)
- [writing about technical stuff which might come in my mind](####writing-about-technical-stuff)
- [train my english](####train-my-english) (at least sometimes üòâ)

## Why is each of these topics important for me?

#### Having a technical playground

Having a technical playground gives me the opportunity to test technical stuff in a simple, pretty good documented environment. I'm planning more difficult project where I want to focus on functionality instead of loosing a lot of time in fixing infrastructure or other technical topics.

#### Getting familiar with popular tools

For the setup I have chosen currently very popular web technologies used by a huge community. At work we are using tools which are suitable for big company and enterprise software. These tools also meet these requirements but they are so common in the traditional german company I'm currently working for.

Using these technologies might help to get new ideas for my daily job. But mainly they should help me to build the stuff I want to build üßëüèª‚Äçüíª. Github is a special choice as I'm using `OpenSource software` hosted there every day. But I never really used Github and maybe getting familiar with it will lower my inhibition level contributing to `OpenSource`.

#### Technical Checklist

The idea is to just write things down I noticed or explored during development. Just to have it available and versioned when I need it. Let's see if this will work.

#### Writing about technical stuff

As I started diving into software architecture and it's theory a lot of stuff is coming to my mind during my daily work. Some I can use at work some I can't. To not to forget all this stuff I now have place to write it down and have it available, when I need it. Next experiment üßëüèª‚Äçüî¨.

#### Train my English

Currently I'm not really using my english skills in my daily life, especially not writing. The idea of writing at least some of the post in english should help me to do not rust in using it...same is for [markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20ist%20eine%20vereinfachte%20Auszeichnungssprache,weitere%20Konvertierung%20leicht%20lesbar%20ist.). And another experiment üòâ.
