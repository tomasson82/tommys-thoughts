## Why am I doing this?

Is there nothing more useful I can do?
Honestly I don't think so for several reasons. First, there is not much I can build by my own 🤓

The idea of this project is:

- having a technical playground for a follow on project
- getting familiar with tools like
  - [Gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
  - [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
  - [Guthub](https://github.com/)
- having a checklist about technical stuff for my own
- writing about technical stuff which might come to mind
- train my english (at least sometimes 😉)

## Why is each of these topics important to me?

#### Having a technical playground

Having a technical playground gives me the opportunity to test technical stuff in a simple, pretty good documented environment. I'm planning a more difficult project where I want to focus on functionality instead of loosing a lot of time in fixing infrastructure or other technical topics.

#### Getting familiar with popular tools

For the setup I have chosen currently very popular web technologies used by a huge community. At work we are using tools which are suitable for big company and enterprise software. And although the used tools meet these requirements they are not so common in the traditional german company like I'm currently working for.

Using these technologies might help me to get new ideas for my daily job. But mainly they are supposed to help me build the stuff I want to build 🧑🏻‍💻. Github is a special choice as I'm using `OpenSource software` hosted there every day. But I never really used `Github` and maybe getting familiar with it will lower my inhibition level contributing to `OpenSource`.

#### Technical Checklist

The idea is to just write things down I noticed or explored during development. Just to have it available and versioned when I need it. Let's see if this will work.

#### Writing about technical stuff

As I started diving into software architecture and it's theory a lot of stuff is coming to my mind during my daily work. Some I can use at work some I can't. To not to forget all this stuff I now have a place to write it down and have it available, when I need it. Next experiment 🧑🏻‍🔬.

#### Train my English

Currently I'm not really using my english skills in my daily life, especially not writing. The idea of writing at least some of the post in english will help me to train using it...same is for [markdown](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#:~:text=Markdown%20ist%20eine%20vereinfachte%20Auszeichnungssprache,weitere%20Konvertierung%20leicht%20lesbar%20ist.). And another experiment 😉.
